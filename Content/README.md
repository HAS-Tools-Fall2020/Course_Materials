# Course Content
This folder is where I will post any notes and presentations we go over in class. In addition the *Cheat_Sheets* has quick guides summarizing major software packages we use and content we cover.

Please do not post any material to the folders in this directory. This is where I will put the materials for you us use.

However **this file** is an open scratch space for anyone to put notes  and pointers so **please add on to this guide with anything you find that is useful**.

## Class definitions
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** – ‘friendlier’ way to access the computer – e.g. Finder, Atom – using point and click.

- **Terminal** – (Shell, GitBash) – also  referred to as command line, operates in the native language of the computer, we use it to give commands directly to the computer (GUIs are a layer over terminal).  Each terminal has its own syntax.  

- **Atom** – a text editor that has built in integration with GitHub (you can do many of the things that we would otherwise do with Terminal (add, commit, push).  It has the same functionality of other text editors (e.g. NotePad, TextPad, TextEditor).  It also has version tracking and plug ins that allow for easier formatting (including mark down files) and to make code editing more efficient.  Also, all of the cool kids use it.

- **Workflow** – sequence of activities used to develop, test, share, apply code.  We will use a common set of tools so that we have a standard workflow for the course.

- **Git** – a file directory that includes hidden files that allow for version control of files in that directory.

- **Github** – a cloud-based program that allows for collaborative work on code with version control.  It has layers of control that allow you to clone repo(sitorie)s to your local environment (your computer) from the remote (cloud) master.  You can pull updates of a repo to stay synced.  You can also upload (push) files to the main repo.  But, a gatekeeper can control what files are uploaded, which allows for coordination of groups working on code.

- **Github Desktop** – a GUI version of Github for managing Github repos.  Feel free to forget this … you have outgrown it.

- **GitKraken** -   Github Desktop, but better.  Way better.
