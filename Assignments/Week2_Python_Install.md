## Setup Instructions

<a name="conda"></a>
#### 1. Install Miniconda
- Download and install the correct version of mini conda for your operating system. You can find all the options [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Make sure you **pick the Python3.x not Python2.x version** for your system. Follow the prompts to install. The default options should be fine.
- Once you have done this you should be able to check you have it installed by typing `conda info` from command line. If it worked you should see all the info for what you just installed.
- If you get a message saying "command not found" when you type `conda info` then you will need to do the following additional steps:
  - open a new git bash window and type `vi .bash_profile`
  - You have now opened a file called ".bash_profile" in the program *vi*. To start editing this file type `i` you will see at the bottom of the screen that it is in insert mode now'
  - now type the following line into your file replacing the 'username' with whatever your user name is on your computer:
  ```
  export PATH="/c/Users/username/miniconda3/Scripts:$PATH"
  ```
  - Once you have typed this line hit the **escape** button to exit insert mode
  - Now hold down the **shift** key and type `zz` to exit and save your changes
  - To be sure you did it right you can `vi .bash_profile` again and you should see the line you added there. To quit without saving type `:q!`
  - Now that we have updated our bash profile we need to source it. So from you terminal type: `source .bash_profile`
  - If this worked you should no longer get a "command not found error" when you type `conda info`
  - Assuming you passed the last test you need to do one more setup step by typing `conda init bash`
  - Finally, to get this last step to take effect you will need to **close your current git bash window and open an new one**.
  - Fingers crossed... this should do it. You can now proceed to step 2!



<a name="environment"></a>
#### 2. Make an environment for this class and activate it
 - Next we will create a python environment for this class. You can follow along directly with the commands I have outlined below. For more details  you should also refer to this [Quick environment setup workflow](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/) or this [moredetailed user-guide for managing environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).
```
conda create --name hastools python=3.8
conda activate hastools
```
 If this was successful you should see 'hastools' in your list of environments if you type
  ```
  conda env list
  ```
  Finally you will want to activate your environment by typing
  ```
  conda activate hastools
  ```
  You should now see the environment name 'hastools' at the start of your command line prompt and if you type `conda env list` again you will see that this is the active environment.

<a name="package"></a>
#### 3. Install our first python packages
For assignment 2 you will need the python packages **pandas** and **matplotlib**. You can install them like this:
  ```
  conda install -c conda-forge  pandas

  ```
  after you have installed a package you can check if its installed by listing the packages in your active environment like this:
  ```
  conda list

  ```
  Remember these steps as you will need to repeat them throughout the semester as we use more  packages.

<a name="vs"></a>
#### **4. Install VS code**
The IDE we will be using this semester is Visual Studio Code, called VS Code for short. Let's get it downloaded.
- **Mac users:**
  - Use this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or just google 'vs code'. Click on *Download for Mac Stable Build*
  - Go to your Downloads folder and click on *VSCode-darwin-stable.zip*. Click and drag the Visual Studio code.app application into your Applications folder.
  - Open the application and make sure you can see the 'Welcome' and 'Untitled' tabs.
    - *Note:*A dialogue box might pop up stating that itâ€™s an application downloaded from the internet, asking if you want to open it. Click Open.

- **Windows users:**
  - Use this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or google vs code. Click on *Download for Windows Stable Build*.
  - Open the download and click the 'I accept the agreement' button.Click 'Next' and then 'Next' (let your machine choose where to put it).
  - When the *Select Addtional Tasks* window pops up, check all of the boxes before hitting 'Next.'
  - Now, you should be able to hit 'Install' and 'Finish.'
  - Open the application.

- After you have installed VS Code you will need to install the Python extension. To do this go to view > extensions on the dropdown menu and then search for 'python'. You want the main one that comes up. It looks like this:
![](assets/Week2_Python_Install-7427ccbd.png)

- After you have installed VS Code you should set it to use the python environment you just made by following the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_where-the-extension-looks-for-environments). If this is  done correctly you should see your python environment in the bottom left corner of your vs code window like this:
![](assets/Week2_Python_Install-376f5919.png)

- It this point you should  try running a python script. When you try to run a script using Python Interactive in VSCode for the first time, you will be prompted in a dialog box to download IPyKernal.

- If you are unable to download IPyKernal, the terminal will load and report an error similar to the below (in addition to a bunch of other text):
```
conda : The term 'conda' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, .....
```

  - The problem is that the default terminal in VSCode (for windows) is power shell. Power shell doesn't work well with VSCode.

  - **The solution is to change the default terminal in VSCode to 'command prompt' using the following steps:**

  1. Hit ctrl+shift+p
  2. Search for 'Terminal: Select Default Shell', and click
  3. There should be a few available, including 'bash', 'power shell', and 'command prompt'. Click on 'command prompt'
  4. Exit and re-enter VSCode for the change to stick.

  - That's it! You should be able to download IPyKernal and run your script now.

  - To further check that 'command prompt' is your default terminal:

  5. Click in the toolbar View > Terminal
  6. At the top of the terminal, you should see a drop-down menu. Listed at the very top should be '1: cmd'.
  7. You can triple check by seeing `conda` and `python` work in the command line. For example, simply type in `conda`, and you'll get back a message starting with `conda is a tool for managing and deploying applications, environments and packages.`.

  - If something went wrong, you'll find a message such as: `bash: conda: command not found`. Try to start at step 1 again.

<a name="training"></a>
## Required Training Activities
- Work through the following sections of Intro to Earth Data Science covering python fundamentals and Python Environments.
  - Read [Chapter 4 Lesson 1](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/python-code-fundamentals/get-started-using-python/) About Python
  - Read and follow along with python commands for [Chapter 4 Lesson 2](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/python-code-fundamentals/get-started-using-python/variables/) Getting started with  Python Variables. You should follow along and try typing the commands yourself. You can either do this by creating a new python file (e.g. "week2.training.py") then within that file you can copy and paste the commands to run them within VS code. Note if you insert '# %%' that will create a block of code in VS code and you can run blocks interactively using the 'run cell' option.  Alternatively you can also  run commands straight from command line by just starting python by typing 'python' from your shell. Then typing commands directly in your shell.



## Optional -- but highly recommended -- training activities
- Get familiar with VS code by checking out  some of their training Materials
  - [Tips and tricks for working in VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks)
  - [Working with GitHub in VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github)
  - [Using terminal in VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal)

## Assignment 2: First Python Forecast
This week you will generate your first streamflow forecast using Python. The rules for this forecast are very similar to last week, no complicated mathematical operations. You are simply going to look at the data and make your best guess forecast  based on whatever logic you want (I repeat no calculations, just your own intuition!). The only difference between this week and last is that you will be using Python to look at the data rather than excel.

#### 1. Download the stream gauge observations to your homework repo
Note that even though you did this last week you are probably going to want to do it again so you can have the most up to date information.
You can use the USGS [mapper](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/) as last time to download the daily streamflow data for station  *09506000 Verde River Near Camp Verde*. Make sure you update your end date so you are getting the latest data to help you make your short term forecasts.  
   - Parameter 00060 Discharge (mean)
   - Start date = 1989-01-01
   - End date = Today
   - Select 'tab separated'

- The data will load in a new tab of your browser. Right click and save it as a *streamflow_week2.txt* file in the *data* folder of your **homework repo**.

### 2. Copy the starter code for this week into your homework repos
For the first assignment I'm providing you with the python code that you will need. You can start from mine and just adjust the slicing to look at or plot different parts of the data as you want. No additional coding required this week!
- Update your course materials repo to get the latest starter code. Copy *week2_firstpython.py* from the Assignment/Starter_Codes folder to your homework repo. ()**REMEMBER:** You cannot push changes to the course materials repo so make sure to do your work in your own homework repo).

### 3. Use the python script to explore the data
- Open the python script in VS code and run it interactively so that you can inspect the data.
- Modify the slicing periods to look at the streamflow for different time periods.

### 4. Submit your first forecast to the competition
- To avoid conflicts make sure your local repo is up to date before you submit your forecast. You can do this with they synch option in github desktop or by doing `git pull`. Refer to the training materials for more information if you forget how to do this.
- Find the csv with your last name in the *forecast_entries* folder and enter your forecasts. Enter your forecasts on the row for foercast #2. A few notes:
    - Make sure you just enter numbers (i.e. enter 5 not 5 cfs)
    - Don't convert the file to an xlsx file keep it as a csv.
    - the one '1week' and '2week' refers to your forecasts for next week and the following week. The 'lt_weekx' columns are for your forecasts for every week of the semester. You can refer to the forecasts_dates files in the Forecast repo for more details.
- Save your changes, commit them, and push your changes. Again you can do this in GitHub desktop or  on command line.

### 5. Submit your forecast homework assignment
In addition to submitting your numerical forecasts to the forecast competition, you also need to submit a description of your forecast through your homework repo. This is what I will be grading for credit.

- Create a file named lastname_HW2.md in the **submission** folder of your homework repo. The easiest way  to do this is just to create a new file in atom.

- Include a header in your file that includes, your name, the date, and the assignment number

- Write a few sentences describing the forecast you made and rational for making it.  Note that we aren't doing anything fancy this week so your rational can be very simple, I'm not looking for a lot of text or any external research. This is really just to practice getting files submitted on GitHub.
